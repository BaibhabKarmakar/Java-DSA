Today we will learn about functions : 
    Functions are some block of codes that can perform a specific task when called by main function() . 

        input -> Function() -> output . 

        The structure of the code to define a function in java is : 
            returnType functionName(type arg1 , type arg2,....) {
                // do something....
                // do task1 ....
                // do task2 ....
                return something in the given datatype if return type is not void . 
            }

    Here what actually happens in memory of the computer while we are calling a function from main function() ?

        It actually froms a stack , at the lowest level the main() and upper from that the function called by main() and so on . 

Lastly ; What are the differences between functions and methods ?
    we can call a function directly but methods can only called by the object of a class .
