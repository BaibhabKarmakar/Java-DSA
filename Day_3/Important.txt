Today In this video we will tlak about : 
    1. if , else
    2. else if
    3. Switch
    4. break
    
    These all are keywords in Java . (Means there are specific meaning of each keyword and can't use the exact keyword as variable name)


    code snippet for if - else statement : 

        task1....
        task2....
        if(Condition) {
            task.....
            do something ...
        }
        else {
            do other thing .....
        }

    code snippet for else-if statement : 

        task1....
        task2....
        if(Condition) {
            task1....
            do something....
        }
        else if(Condition) {
            task2....
            do something....
        }
        else {
            task3....
            do something....
        }


    Here there is a structural change if only one line is there in "if" or "else" block of code . (Basically we can then neglect the curly braces of the statement)

        if(Condition) 
            one task....
        else 
            only task ....

    But if there are more than one task or line of code then it is necessary to give the "{}" (curly braces) to maintain the code . 

    Code snippet of Switch statement : 

        switch (options) {
            case option1 : 
                task.....
                do something....
                break;
            case option2 : 
                task.....
                do something.....
                break;
            default : 
                task....
                do something....
                break;
        }


        here "break" is the keyword which is used to break and get rid of the code block from the immediate block . (case block or if - else block !).

Home work Problem : 
    Make a calculator using Switch statement . 
    Have already done !
