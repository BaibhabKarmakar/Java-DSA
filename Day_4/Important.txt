Today we will talk about Loops :

    1. "for" Loops
    2. "while" loop
    3. "do while" loop


    Structure for "for" loop :
 
        for(initialisation ; condition ; updation) {
            // Do Something....
        }

    Structure of "while" loop : 
    
        initialisation
        while(condition) {
            // Do Something...
            updation
        }

    Structure for "do - while" loop : 

        initialisation
        do {
            // Do Something...
            updation
        }
        while(condition)

    // Here "for" loop and "while" loop working is exactly same under any conditions , but "do - while" loop works slightly differently . 
    // In "do - while" loop we will execute the statement atleast once ; no matter the condition is true or false . but from the 2nd iteration , we will check the condition and then we will proceed .
